# Movie-Ticket-Booking-System-Using-File-Handling

This project is written in the C programming language and utilizes various concepts of the language such as conditional statements, loops, arrays, functions, structures and file handling.

The program starts with a main menu that offers different options for the user such as booking a new ticket, canceling an existing ticket, registration, and so on. Once the user selects an option, the program takes them to the corresponding function that performs the desired action.

The program also includes file handling in which a file is created that stores information about the movies, user details, and booking details. The user can choose the movie that they want to watch and select the seats they want to book. The program also generates a ticket with all the necessary details such as the movie name, showtime, seat number, and so on.

Overall, the movie ticket booking system project is a practical application of the C programming language that utilizes various programming concepts to make the movie ticket booking process more convenient and efficient for customers.
